I am new to Python and Web development.
It is really very cool to set up a web application.
I have read about PHP,Python,Node.js.
Finally I choose Python + Flask.
However, it is no easy to start.
When it comes to MySQL, SQLALChemy, html, css, js,
I do feel a bad headache.
Fortunately, there are lots of materials around the  on Google.
I searched and tried much.
Today, I finished a draft web application.
They are Python3, MySQL, SQLAlChemy, Form.
I do believe it is good for lots of newcomers.
Though there are many stuffs about them, however there
is no complete one we can easily get.
Cool?Ugly?
This is just the very first step.
I can add more into it.
Welcome aboard!
